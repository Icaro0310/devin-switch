# devin-switch — Corporate Windows guide

This guide covers restricted Windows setup only. For unrestricted Windows, see [README.windows.md](README.windows.md); for features, shared commands, limitations, and the safety model, see [README.md](README.md).

Corporate Windows is a local-only environment: no Devin VM, QwenPaw, Slack dependency, external compute, workload delegation or required external integration.

## Prerequisites

- `uv` and Python 3.10 or newer; `uv` can manage Python.

## Install

Install the isolated Python CLI:

```powershell
uv tool install "https://github.com/Icaro0310/devin-switch/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz"
```

## Devin paths

Session data normally lives under `%APPDATA%\devin\cli\`; UI state and ACP stores under `%APPDATA%\Devin\User\`.
Use the tool's documented `--data-dir` or `--config-dir` flags for non-default locations.

## Environment notes

- Keep execution local; do not configure VM, QwenPaw, external compute or workload delegation.
- Registry-declared external integrations remain optional and are not installed by this guide.
- macOS is planned but not claimed as tested.

## Corporate Windows specifics

- **No admin rights needed:** `uv` and every tool install under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`/`%APPDATA%` — nothing writes to `Program Files`, the registry, or requires elevation.
- **Proxy:** set `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` before installing. Per session: `$env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy:port"`; persistently: `setx HTTPS_PROXY "http://proxy:port"`. `uv`, `pip` and `npm` honor them.
- **TLS inspection:** if the corporate proxy intercepts TLS, point the installer at the company CA bundle: `$env:REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE="C:\path\corp-root.pem"`. Certificate errors at install time mean the proxy, not the package.
- **Execution policy:** installed CLIs are real executables — `Set-ExecutionPolicy` only matters for `.ps1` scripts from a checkout; `-Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` suffices, no admin.
- **Blocked installers:** if winget/Store are disabled by policy, `uv` installs as a standalone binary — download the GitHub release zip, extract to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bin`, add it to PATH.
- **Long paths:** keep checkout/install roots short (`C:\dev`) — MAX_PATH (260 chars) can still bite inside virtualenvs; `LongPathsEnabled` needs admin, short roots do not.
- **EDR/antivirus:** if a scan kills the install, retry with an exclusion or ask IT to allowlist `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv` and `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`. These tools never elevate or listen on the network by default.
- **Offline/air-gapped:** `pip download <package> -d wheels\` on a connected machine, copy the folder, then `pip install --no-index --find-links wheels\` on the target (pure-Python tools; native deps need a matching platform wheel).

## Troubleshooting

- If a command is not found, reopen PowerShell and run `uv tool update-shell`.
